This guide explains how to [deploy Primeagent on Railway](https://railway.com/?utm_medium=integration&utm_source=docs&utm_campaign=primeagent), a cloud infrastructure platform that provides auto-deploy, managed databases, and automatic scaling.

1. Create a Railway account.

   A Hobby account on Railway is sufficient for Primeagent's dual-core CPU and 2 GB RAM requirements. For more information, see [Railway pricing](https://railway.com/pricing?utm_medium=integration&utm_source=docs&utm_campaign=primeagent).

2. Follow this link to deploy the Primeagent template on Railway:

3. Optional: Add any custom configuration for your Primeagent deployment.

   The Primeagent Railway template automatically sets up the infrastructure, deploys Primeagent, and then starts the application.

4. Wait for the deployment to complete.

5. Navigate to your Primeagent instance at your deployment's public URL, such as `https://APP-NAME.up.railway.app`.

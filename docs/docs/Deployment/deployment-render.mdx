This guide explains how to deploy Primeagent on [Render](https://render.com/), a cloud platform for deploying web applications and APIs.

1. Prepare a Render instance that can support Primeagent.

   Primeagent requires at least 2 GB of RAM to run, so you must use a Render instance type of **Standard** or better.
   This requires a paid Render account.
   For more information, see [Render Web Services](https://render.com/docs/web-services) and [Render pricing](https://render.com/pricing).

2. Follow this link to start a Primeagent deployment on Render:

3. Enter a blueprint name, select the branch for your `render.yaml` file, and then click **Deploy Blueprint**.

When deployment is complete, your Primeagent instance is ready to use.
